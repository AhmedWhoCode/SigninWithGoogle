# SigninWithGoogle
Function: loginInWithGoogle(with:)
This function allows users to log in with their Google account using Google Sign-In. It handles the sign-in process and retrieves the necessary authentication data for further usage.

Parameters:
viewController: The view controller from which the Google Sign-In process is initiated.
Usage:
Ensure that the Firebase client ID is properly configured in your Firebase project.
Call this function passing the relevant view controller as the parameter.
Example:
swift
Copy code
// Call the loginInWithGoogle function from your view controller
loginInWithGoogle(with: self)
Behavior:
The function verifies the presence of the Firebase client ID. If it is missing, the function returns without performing any further action.
If the client ID is present, the function initiates the Google Sign-In process, presenting the provided view controller for authentication.
If the sign-in process encounters an error, an error message is printed to the console, and no further action is taken.
If the user is signed in successfully, the function retrieves the user's ID token and access token.
The retrieved tokens can be used to create a Google authentication credential for further authentication purposes. You can add your specific logic and functionality after this step.
Note: Make sure you have properly configured Firebase and the necessary frameworks for Google Sign-In in your project.

For more information on how to integrate Google Sign-In into your iOS app, refer to the official documentation provided by Google and Firebase.

Happy coding!
